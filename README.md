# LawlCat
# by Nicholas Lantz

A character-wise version of lolcat. It is not as fully features as the original
(found [here](https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat)), but it does output pretty
colors! It doesn't even need the line to end, it will happily print out
characters before the newline character.
